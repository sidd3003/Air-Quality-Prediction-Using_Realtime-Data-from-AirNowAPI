# Air Quality Prediction Using Real-time Data from AirNow API

Our machine learning project addresses the limitations of existing air quality prediction systems by focusing on California at the county level. These systems often struggle with accuracy due to their reliance on predictions made hours in advance, overlooking real-time fluctuations in air quality.

To overcome this, we developed an enhanced prediction system that leverages granular latitude-longitude data for real-time calculations. By incorporating real-time data, our system captures the dynamic nature of air pollution more accurately throughout the day.

We employed machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, to process the data and generate predictions. After thorough experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, XGBoost emerged as the most effective algorithm, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99%.

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in accurately predicting air quality at the county level in California, offering valuable insights for environmental monitoring and policy-making.
